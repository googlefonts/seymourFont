# Seymour One
By Vernon Adams

![Sample of SeymourOne.](documentation/image1.png)

Seymour One is derived from the earlier webfont Sigmar One, but the forms have also been influenced by late nineteenth and early twentieth century British sans-serif typefaces. The result is a display face that is ideal for bold, unpretentious, and slightly playful display typography. Seymour One is designed to be used conventionally but also as an 'all caps' font.
